# DevOps

DevOps isn't just a buzzword â€” it represents the fusion of Development and Operations within the software development realm. It's not merely a set of tools but a cultural shift embedded in Agile Development methodologies, aimed at breaking down the silos between teams and technologies.

<br/>Some of the benfits include:
* Collaboration
* Rapid Deployment and Release
* Increase in trust and transparency
* Automation


## Embracing Collaboration and Speed
Let's dive into the heart of DevOps with two compelling options:
### Option 1: Manual Build with Continuous Deployment (ADF Publish)
In this approach, developers wield control over the build process, triggering deployments through Azure Data Factory (ADF) Publish. While providing a semblance of control, this method might lengthen deployment cycles and heighten the risk of human error.

### Option 2: Automated Build (Continuous Integration) with Continuous Deployment
Embrace automation with this option. Continuous Integration (CI) automates build processes upon code changes, while Continuous Deployment (CD) ensures seamless deployment to target environments. Expect faster, error-free deployments.

### Git Configuration: The Backbone of Collaboration

We adopt an approach where we create feature branches for making edits and merge them into the main branch. The main branch serves as the collaborator branch, this is a simplified version of the recommended *Gitflow workflow*.This approach allows for parallel development efforts without disrupting the stability of the main codebase. Additionally, it facilitates code review and collaboration among team members through pull requests.

### Software Environments: Crafting Realistic Stages
It's essential to ensure that different software environments are established for isolation and to mimic various scopes, ensuring optimal software performance. 

<br/>From Development to Production, our software environments mirror real-world scenarios:

- **Development Environment**: This environment is where developers work on new features and bug fixes. It should closely resemble the production environment to catch issues early in the development process.

- **Testing Environment**: The testing environment is used for testing new features and changes before they are deployed to production. It should mimic the production environment as closely as possible to ensure accurate testing results.

- **Production Environment**: The production environment is where the live application runs and serves end-users. It's crucial to maintain the stability and reliability of this environment to ensure uninterrupted service for users.
